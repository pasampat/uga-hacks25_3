Purpose of project: Using python we created a program that queries the Gemini AI for the ten most popular songs in the decade entered by the user and if the user also entered a mood the program displays the 10 most popular songs from the specified decade that fit the theme and displays the results on a webpage.

Tools utilized: Gemini AI API, Python, HTML, CSS, Flask

Problems: We had trouble accessing an AI because many of them need an API key and none of us had knowledge of how to get an API key. We split up and each of us tried using a lot of different AIs and AI configurations including Huggingface and importing the transport python package on our local machine so we didn't need an API key but AIs on local machines required either training or pre trained models which we didn't have the time, knowledge, or will to implement. We tried to use the OpenAI API but the process of getting an API key was difficult. We settled on the Gemini API because we could get and use the key in our code relatively easily.

Public frameworks used: Gemini API
